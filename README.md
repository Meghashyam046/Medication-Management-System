# Medication Management System

## 1. Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a **Medication Management application** designed for both **patients** and **caretakers**. The application will offer role-based dashboards, robust medication tracking capabilities, and other essential features to help users manage medication schedules effectively.

### Target Users:

- **Patients:** To track their own medication intake, view schedules, and monitor adherence.
- **Caretakers:** To manage medications for multiple patients, track their progress, and facilitate communication.

### Core Objectives:

- Implement secure **User Authentication** using SQLite for login and signup.
- Provide complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality for medication management.
- Develop **role-based dashboards** to display relevant information for patients and caretakers.
- Ensure **data persistence** by connecting the frontend to a Node.js backend with an SQLite database.

- ## Technology Stack

The project requires proficiency in the following technologies:

### Frontend:

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript:** The core programming language for frontend logic.
- **React Query:** A powerful library for fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating server state in React applications.
- **CSS:** For styling the application.

### Backend:

- **Node.js:** A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications and APIs.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight, file-based relational database management system.
